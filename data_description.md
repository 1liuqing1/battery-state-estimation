# UNIBO Powertools Dataset

The UNIBO Powertools Dataset has been collected in a laboratory test by an Italian Equipment producer. The cycling experiments are designed to analyze different cells intended for use in various cleaning equipment such as vacuum and automated floor cleaners. The vast dataset is composed of 27 batteries. The main features of the dataset are:
(1) the use of batteries from different manufacturers, (2) cells with several nominal capacities, (3) cycling is performed until the cell's end-of-life and thus data regarding the cell at different life stages are produced. Three types of tests have been conducted. (I) The standard test, where the battery was discharged at 5A current in main cycles. (II), the high current test, where the battery was discharged at 8A current in main cycles. (III), the preconditioned test, where the battery cells are stored at 45Â°C environments for 90 days before conducting the test. During discharge, the sampling period is 10 seconds.

| cycle_count          | charge/discharge cycle count. It goes from 0 to 100 for the main cycle and from 0 to 1000 for the resistance cycle. The two cycles are interleaved i.e. 0->100->0->1000->0->100...       |

# Battery cycling procedure

1) delivery SOC verification

    discharge at 5A until V<sub>eod</sub> (line code: 12)

2) capacity test

    CC-CV charge at 1A until cutoff=4.2V, termination at 0,05A (line code: 17)

    discharge, 0,2A (line code: 19)

3) resistance cycle

    two steps alternated:

    first step, discharge at 0,5A for 10s (line code: 29)

    second step, discharge at 5A for 1s (line code: 30)

4) main cycle

    CC-CV charge at 1.8A until cutoff=4.2V, termination at 0,1A (line code: 37)

    discharge at 5A until V<sub>eod</sub> (line code: 40)

5) repeat the main cycle (point 4) 100 times, then perform a capacity test (point 2) and a resistance cycle (point 3), redo point 5

# Test name convention

000-XW-Y.Y-AABB-T

---

000 = sample serial number

X = lecter related to cell manufacturer

W = cell type | P: powertool, M: mid power, E: e-byke

Y.Y = cell capacity e.g. 2.5Ah -> 2.5

AABB = samples delivery date (AA: week, bb: year)

T = test type | S: Standard (5A discharge), H: High Current (8A discharge), P: Pre-conditioned (90 days storing at 45C degree before testing)
